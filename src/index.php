      When asked about her responsibilities at home, Ayesha smiles. She says,
      “From my early childhood, I used to bring firewood from the nearby
      forest, prepare feed for cattle, clean house and [do] other work,”
      including caring for her younger siblings. For many years her daily
      routine has been long and tiresome and she hasn't had anyone to think
      about her health or future. Before going to sleep at the end of the day
      she needed to first complete all of her tasks, which left her with no
      time to live her own life..

      When a series of missteps strands them together in the wilderness, these four
      broken souls soon realize that their only defense against the brutality
      of nature is one another. As one day without rescue spirals dramatically 
      into the next, and misadventure turns to nightmare, they begin to form 
      an inextricable bond, pushing themselves and one another further than 
      they ever could have dreamed possible. The three who make it home alive 
      will be forever changed by their harrowing days on the mountain.

      Two roads diverged in a yellow wood, and sorry I could not travel both 
      and be one traveler. Long I stood and looked down one as far as I could, 
      to where it bent in the undergrowth. Then took the other, as just as fair
      and having perhaps the better claim because it was grassy and wanted wear.
      Though as for that the passing there, had worn them really about the same.
      And both that morning equally lay In leaves no step had trodden black.
      Oh, I kept the first for another day! Yet knowing how way leads on to way, 
      I doubted if I should ever come back.
